We will compute the train error and the test error, and we will see how they behave as a function of the parameter $k$ or of the degrees of freedom $N/k$. Then, we will introduce **scikit-learn** that allows us to implement kNN (and much more) in a very simple way. Finally, we will apply what we have learnt to a real, and very famous, dataset."
